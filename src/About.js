      <h2> About the Festival </h2>
      <p>
        The UNFRAMED FESTIVAL is an open format festival using Cultures and Arts
        as tools of empowerment and resistance within annually changing
        political topics. Crossover artworks, talks and workshops raise
        questions about contemporary issues of our societies and provide space
        for dialogues and collective creativity. A multicultural program for a
        journey where debates are raised and Utopias are defined as spaces of
        the possible.
      </p>

      <h2> About Us </h2>
      <p>
        The UNFRAMED Society exists since 2015 with the aim to make
        socio-political discourses that often go unheard present and to raise
        the debate about them. We want to make the social power relations we
        live in visible and give a voice to people, movements and groups who
        talk about their own struggles, realities and stories. It is central to
        us that we talk with each other and not about each other. Artists,
        experts and acitivists are invited to discuss, exchange, to raise new
        questions and answer some others - all in the idea to bring together
        different perspectives and realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UNFRAMED Festival sees itself as a space of encounter that
        stimulates mutual understanding and awareness between different
        personalities, practices, backgrounds, languages and countries. For this
        we tie together divers forms of expression. We link art, theatre, film,
        dance, performance and music with science, literature, talks,
        discussions and workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Art and communication is seen as a tool for empowerment, resistance and
        visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to create a free stage which brings together art, activism and
        the public for an annually changing debate to discuss, think, dream and
        connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our association “Unframed e.V.” supports the organisation of the
        Unframed Festival together with other socio-political events.
