              <p>
                A website template built on React and a filterable database on
                Google Sheets.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                You can use this database to hold any type of linked media
                content, plain text or even HTML. This means you can create
                pages like a portfolio, an events program, or a personal blog.
              </p>
              <p>
                This page is a demo, and you can find the code and a tutorial on
                usage at the{" "}

              <h3 className="highlighted">Why?</h3>
              <p>
                Because your team's working spreadsheet is already a database.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because small teams use spreadsheets anyway to prepare their
                data before publishing them online.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because they don't need to re-enter the data somewhere else.
              </p>
              <p>
                For small projects, this makes it easier to prototype and
                maintain a website without having to use an additional database
                or a special user interface for data entry and editing like on
                Wordpress or tumblr.
              </p>
              <p>
                To simplify things, this app takes the data directly from your
                working sheet, and whenever it's updated, it's instantly visible
                on the live website.
              </p>
              <h3 className="highlighted">Data for this Demo</h3>
              <p>
                The <NavLink to="/program">program</NavLink> section is a demo
                of a program of events filterable by dates and categories. Each
                event has data such as title, artist/author, photo, location,
                teaser_text, and text. You can view{" "}
